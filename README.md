## Description
A modpack utility mod masquerading as an enchantment mod. Extra Damage Enchantments connects datapacks to the "entity group" system, and additionally
adds 5 new damaging enchantments to make use of the new system.

An issue with modpacks is that new mobs often don't fall into the vanilla categories of undead, arthropod, and aquatic. ExtraDE adds 5 additional
categories that cover the majority of use-cases.  
Each category, along with the vanilla groupings, is a datapack tag. This creates a convenient compatibility layer for modpacks to use and add additional
mobs.

ExtraDE also adds custom group icons for Provi's Health Bars and Neat. Using PHB will also grant new custom health bar portraits.

## New Entity Groups
- Humanoid (`extra_de:humanoid`)
  - Receives extra damage from the Rebel enchantment.
  - Consists of human and humanlike mobs (Players, Villagers, Piglins).
- OuterWorldly (`extra_de:outerworldly`)
  - Receives extra damage from the Voidrender enchantment.
  - Consists of _dimensional_ mobs (Endermen, Ender Dragon).
- Arcane (`extra_de:arcane`)
  - Receives extra damage from the Unravel enchantment.
  - Consists of mobs that are _made of magic_ (Allays, Vexes).
